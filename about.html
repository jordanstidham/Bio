My mission is to create valuable content that helps stakeholders understand the driving factors behind our business. Whether it’s an update, news, or sharing success stories, I believe through clear, concise, and accurate messaging, that we can strengthen partnership engagement and foster collaboration. I’m lucky enough to write for audiences of up to 700 people with a passion for STEM, which is incredibly rewarding.
