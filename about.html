    <h2>BIO</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am a flexible communications specialist living in Tennessee with 5 years of experience in different fields such as design, social media, and communications. My mission is to create valuable content that helps stakeholders understand the driving factors behind our business. Whether it’s an update, news, or sharing success stories, I believe through clear, concise, and accurate messaging, that we can strengthen partnership engagement and foster collaboration. I’m lucky enough to write for audiences of up to 700 people with a passion for STEM, which is incredibly rewarding. If you would like to get in touch, please reach out to me via email at stidhamjordan@gmail.com. I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
